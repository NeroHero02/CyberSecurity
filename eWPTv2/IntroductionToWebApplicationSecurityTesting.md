## Introduction To Web Application Security Testing

Web Applications : are software programs that run on web servers and accessible over the internet through web browsers.  

Web Applications They are designed to provide interactive and dynamic functionality.  

Examples of Web applications include:

- Social Media Platforms(Facebook,Twiteer,etc...)  
- Online Email Services (Gmail,Outlook)
- E-commerce Websites (Amazon,eBay)
- Cloud-based productivity tools(Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365)

**How Do Web Applications Works?**  

The Client-Server Architecture : Web Applications follow the client-server model, where the application's logic and data are hosted on a web server, and users access it using web browsers on their devices.  

User Interface (UI) :  The user interface of web applications is usually presented through a combination of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive interfaces.  

Internet Connectivity: Web applications require an internet connection for users to access them. Users interact with the application by sending requests to the server, which processes those requests and sends back the appropriate responses.  

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Web applications are accessible from different devices and operating systems without requiring installation or specific software, making them platform-independent.  

Statelessness: HTTP, the protocol used for communication between web browsers and servers, is stateless. Web applications must manage user sessions and state to remember user interactions and ensure continuity.  

**Web Application Security** 

Authentication : Who you ?  
Authorization : What is you'r permissions?  

**Web Application Security Testing**  

Web Application Security Testing is the process of evaulating and assessing the security aspects of web applications to idnetify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential security risks.  

Types of security testing conducted on web applications :  

1. Vulnerability Scanning : Using automated tools to scan the web application for known vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting(XSS), insecure configurations, and outdated software versions.  

2. Penetration Testing: Simulating real-world attacs to access the application's defenses and identify potential security weaknesses.

3. Code Review and Start Analysis: Manual examination of the application's source code to identify coding flaws, security misconfigurations, and potential security risks.  

4. Authentication and Authorization Testing : Evaluating the effectiveness of authentication mechanisms and access control features to ensure that only authorized users have appropriate access levels.  

5. Input Validation and Output Encoding Testing : Assessing how the application handles user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.  

6. Session Management Testing: Verifying how the application manages user sessions and related tokens to prevent session-related attacks.  

7. API Security Testing: Assessing the security of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) used by the web application for data exchange and integration with other systems.  

8. Web application pentesting : is a subset of web application security testing that specifically involves attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities.  

**Web App Pentesting vs Web App Security Testing**  

1. Scope: Web application security testing covers a broader range of assessments, including static and dynamic analysis, while web application pentesting focuses on actively exploiting vulnerabilities.  

2. Objective: The primary goal of security testing is to identify weaknesses, whereas pentesting aims to validate vulnerabilities and assess the organization's ability to detect and respond to attacks.  

3. Methodology: Security testing includes both manual and automated techniques, while pentesting is predominantly a manual process, involving the use of various tools and techniques for exploitation.  

4. Exploitation: Security testing does not involve exploitation of vulnerabilities, while pentesting does, albeit in a controlled and authorized manner.
