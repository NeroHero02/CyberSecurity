## Introduction To Web Application Security Testing

Web Applications : are software programs that run on web servers and accessible over the internet through web browsers.  

Web Applications They are designed to provide interactive and dynamic functionality.  

Examples of Web applications include:

- Social Media Platforms(Facebook,Twiteer,etc...)  
- Online Email Services (Gmail,Outlook)
- E-commerce Websites (Amazon,eBay)
- Cloud-based productivity tools(Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365)

**How Do Web Applications Works?**  

The Client-Server Architecture : Web Applications follow the client-server model, where the application's logic and data are hosted on a web server, and users access it using web browsers on their devices.  

User Interface (UI) :  The user interface of web applications is usually presented through a combination of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive interfaces.  

Internet Connectivity: Web applications require an internet connection for users to access them. Users interact with the application by sending requests to the server, which processes those requests and sends back the appropriate responses.  

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Web applications are accessible from different devices and operating systems without requiring installation or specific software, making them platform-independent.  

Statelessness: HTTP, the protocol used for communication between web browsers and servers, is stateless. Web applications must manage user sessions and state to remember user interactions and ensure continuity.  

**Web Application Security** 

Authentication : Who you ?  
Authorization : What is you'r permissions?
